# Contributing to SOLON Protocol

Thank you for your interest. SOLON has no owner — only contributors.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Start Small
- Read the [Whitepaper](WHITEPAPER.md)
- Open an issue with questions, critiques, or ideas
- Comment on existing issues and pull requests

### 2. Code
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/tick-contract`)
- Write tests
- Submit a pull request with a clear description

### 3. Non-Code Contributions
- **Economics**: Model the Tick system — simulate different demurrage rates, distribution curves, inter-Agora exchange
- **Architecture**: Design Agora spatial guidelines based on Jane Jacobs' principles
- **Legal**: Research legal frameworks for community currencies, DAOs, and cooperative governance in your jurisdiction
- **Translation**: Translate the whitepaper into your language
- **Documentation**: Improve docs, write tutorials, create diagrams

### 4. Start an Agora
You don't need permission. You need:
- 10+ people
- A shared space (can be a kitchen table)
- The Chronos Wallet (when available) or a spreadsheet to start
- A willingness to experiment

Document your experience. Share it. Every Agora is an experiment that teaches all others.

## Code Standards

- Solidity contracts: Follow [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html)
- All contracts must have >95% test coverage
- All PRs require at least one review
- Security-critical code requires two reviews and an audit trail

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs, features, and technical discussion
- **Discussions**: For broader questions, philosophy, and Agora experiences

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. Be honest. Be constructive. The same principles that govern the Agora govern this repository.

If you disagree, argue with the idea, not the person. If you're wrong, say so. If you're right, be generous about it.

## License

All contributions are licensed under MIT. By contributing, you agree that your work will be freely available to anyone.
