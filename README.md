The Solon Protocol (v0.1-alpha)
"Money is Time. State is Coordination. Labor is Meaning."

Vision
The Solon Protocol is an open-source, decentralized operating system for society in the age of abundance. Based on the principles of mathematical scarcity and post-quantum cryptographic security, it aims to decouple state and money while providing a modular framework for liquid democracy.

Core Pillars
Proof-of-Contribution: A reputation-based resource allocation system (Decaying Soulbound Tokens).

Dual-Asset Economy: Integrating Bitcoin as a primary reserve while utilizing the Solon Wallet (an algorithmic currency with demurrage) for local circulation.

Liquid Governance: Privacy-preserving voting mechanisms using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).

Roadmap
Phase I (Feb 2026): Release of MONEY – The Storage of Time (Book 1) and initial protocol whitepaper.

Phase II (Mid 2026): Alpha testing of the Solon-Wallet pallet on Substrate.

Phase III (Late 2026): Launch of the STATE (Book 2) and the first regional pilot nodes.

Join the Evolution
We are looking for Rust developers, cryptographers, and UI/UX designers who believe in a future of voluntary coordination.
